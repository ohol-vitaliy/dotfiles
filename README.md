# Just another dotfiles repo

Dotfiles written or found by me and used on an everyday basis

Consists of:
  * Settings for:
    * vim
    * tmux
    * bash prompt
    * sxhkd
    * urxvt
    * dunst
    * htop
    * nano
    * rofi
  * Bunch of fancy aliases and scripts at `.aliasrc`
  * Customized colorful bash prompt at `.config/promptrc`

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/MisterVitaliy/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
make dotfiles
```
Script creates symlinks instead of moving all files to the home directory.  
**CAUTION: installation of this dotfiles will remove your configs without the ability to restore it!**  

*`make help` can be used to find other options*
